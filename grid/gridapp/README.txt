Greetings, grader!

This is a cordial readme to inform you of what you need to know to navigate this submission.

griddapp.c is the final version of my grid app submission. It will compile under
linux with the -lpthread flag, and it will compile under windows using cl (Microsoft's 
command-line C compiler). 

It's a touch slow, but it works. 

writeup.txt contains my writeup for this submission, in bullet-point form. It uses UNIX line
endings, though.

If I get it uploaded in time, gridstats.pdf will contain my statistics and graphs.

That's all.
